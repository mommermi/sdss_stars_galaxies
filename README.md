# Identifying Stars and Galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Photometric Data

This toy project investigates whether it is possible to distinguish
between stars, elliptical galaxies, and spiral galaxies using a
machine learning approach and measured photometric properties.

The answer is **yes**!

For the full results, have a look at this [jupyter
