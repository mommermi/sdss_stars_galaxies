# Identifying Stars and Galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Photometric Data

This toy project investigates whether it is possible to distinguish
between stars, elliptical galaxies, and spiral galaxies using a
machine learning approach and measured photometric properties.

The answer is **yes**!

For the full results, have a look at this [jupyter
notebook](https://github.com/mommermi/sdss_stars_galaxies/blob/master/sdss_stars_galaxies.ipynb).

For a (very) brief presentation of this project at the 2019 Flagstaff
Astronomy Symposium, please see see the pdf file in this repository.
